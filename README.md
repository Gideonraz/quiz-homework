# quiz-homework
To create this quiz page I created an html file and added a start button to it and created some rules to the quiz. Then I created a quiz box and a results box with a timer. Then I created two javascript files, one for the questions and one for the actual quiz. Then I wrote all the questions and its choices and the answers in that file. Then in the script.js file I created the quiz and all possible options in there. Then I created a timer of 15 seconds on each question. Then I created the outcomes and results for the buttons and what they are supposed to do. Then I also made it so that if it is correct it comes up as green and if wrong it comes up as red. At the end it will tell you how many you got right out of all 5 questions.
